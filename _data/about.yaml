Abstract: >
  This is a general purpose website template for conveying your data, code, and
  overall scientific story to the general public! See the
  [GitHub](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_website) for the actual code
  used to generate this website, along with lengthy documentation about how to use
  it. This is meant to be used in tandem with the [GitHub repository template for
  reproducible research](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_research). The
  Rest of this website is filled with dummy text (my favorite, [Hiptser
  Ipsum](https://hipsum.co/)) for demonstrative purposes. It can even include
  math like


  $$S = k_b\ln \Omega. \tag{1}$$

  Microtubules are dynamically stable subcellular structures that play a vital role 
  in cell stability, mitotosis, intracellular transport, and motility.
  Research investigating these structures generally involves the use of modern
  microscopy techniques to probe both static and dynamic properties associated 
  with these structural units.
  Hydrolysis of the GDP-bound tubulin subunit at the end of the tubule results in 
  the onset of a process known as microtubule catastrophe.
  Catastrophe is characterized by the rapid depolymerization and shrinkage of the tubule structure.
  In a seminal body of work, Gardner and collaborators explore and constrain processes 
  historically hypothesized to be associated with catastrophe dynamics. 
  Our work aimed to recapitulate and possibly reinterpret the results of this paper using 
  various statistical techniques to investigate both the efficacy of the experimental design 
  and throughly model the event distribution associated catastrophe kinetics.
