  Microtubule Calamity

Abstract: >
  Microtubules are dynamically stable subcellular structures that play a vital role 
  in cell stability, mitotosis, intracellular transport, and motility.
  Research investigating these structures generally involves the use of modern
  microscopy techniques to probe both static and dynamic properties associated 
  with these structural units.
  Hydrolysis of the GDP-bound tubulin subunit at the end of the tubule results in 
  the onset of a process known as microtubule catastrophe.
  Catastrophe is characterized by the rapid depolymerization and shrinkage of the tubule structure.
  In a seminal body of work, Gardner and collaborators explore and constrain processes 
  historically hypothesized to be associated with catastrophe dynamics. 
  Our work aimed to recapitulate and possibly reinterpret the results of this paper using 
  various statistical techniques to investigate both the efficacy of the experimental design 
  and throughly model the event distribution associated catastrophe kinetics.
